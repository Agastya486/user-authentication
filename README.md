# Introduction
This is a simple login system made with vanilla PHP.

# Additional information
*Im using password_verify() function to compare password that users input with the hashed password in database. Its not 100% secure, and i'll streghthen its security in the next version.

*make sure to use XAMPP/similiar software in order to run the code. Also, you can create and configure the database by adding a id, username, and password

# How to run the code
1. Download all the file
2. on "conn.php", you can change the "mydb"(in the dbname/database name) as you want
